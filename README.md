## DEMO

- [API Endpoint at `/api`](https://monolith-express-react.sutanlab.id/api/voucher)

## Why i made this?
Short Answer: ***Personal Purpose***

Long Answer: Because me (or maybe you?) want to build a monorepo/monolith project with Express and React which combines server and frontend in one repository. Of course, it's cost-effective!

The reason why it's cost-effective are:
- That's right, because it's simpler and can be deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for free.
- Because `Backend` and `Frontend` only have one `node_modules`.
- Because `Backend` and `Frontend` can share code with each other.
- The irony is, because you're the both `Backend` and `Frontend`.

## Setup
- Clone repository `$ git clone https://github.com/sutanlab/monolith-express-react.git`

- Install depedencies
```bash
# with npm
$ npm install

# or with yarn

- Run server in development mode

- Build optimize production mode
```bash

- Start server in production mode
